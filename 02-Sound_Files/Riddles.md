# Riddles

These are the clues we recorded and their corresponding conductive objects.

1. Plant or leaf

	This thing’s not a human body
	But it often has some veins
	It falls from a deciduous
	On evergreens it remains


2. Apple

	This is something that grows on a tree
	It is a fruit that is green or red
	It’s said gravity was discovered
	When one of these fell on Newton’s head


3. A glass of water

	I go solid in freezers
	In rivers I can flow
	My chemical formula
	Is known as H2O

4. Gold (we used a ring)

	Comething very shiny
	And is a valuable metal
	If you win at the Olympics
	It’s the color of your medal


5. Thumb 

	It is shorter than the rest 
	but when you are happy 
	You raise it up like
	It’s the best


6. A key

	Although I’m not a diamond
	I get put on a ring
	When it is time to use me
	A lock is opening


7. Coin

	Although I am not a salad
	I am something that can be tossed
	When you need to buy something cheap
	I might be used to pay its cost


8. Fork

	I have four legs,
	but I don’t have feet
	I come in handy 
	when it’s time to eat
