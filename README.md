# Treasure Hunt
A fun and interactive activity to help kids learn about conductive materials.

Made in collaboration with Fiona Fox and [Daniel Dallago](www.danieldallago.com) for kid's day üéà. 

## What you'll need
- A treasure map. You can download this [one](https://github.com/ruieduardonunes/treasure-hunt/blob/master/01-Map/01-Map_Print.pdf) we've made earlier;
- Voice recordings of the riddles. You can record your own, or use [this](https://github.com/ruieduardonunes/treasure-hunt/tree/master/02-Sound_Files);
- A Bare Conductive Touch Board and Electric Paint. *You can get them [here](https://www.bareconductive.com/shop/)*;
- Ten alligator wires;
- A speaker;
- Conductive objects - we've used [this](https://github.com/ruieduardonunes/treasure-hunt/blob/master/02-Sound_Files/Riddles.txt) ones for our riddles;
- Prizes üç≠! 

## How To
- Start by printing the map. We recommend you print it in A0. This allows for kids to get around and play together in a table.
- On the back of the map, using the Electric Ink, paint a circle that matches each number in the front. When done, paint a line that connects each circle to the very top of the page where you'll later connect the Touch Board. Please, refere to the image bellow:

- While the ink dries, move over to the Touch Board. Upload this code provided by the team at Bare Conductive (Thanks!).
- Upload the audio files to the Touch Board memory card. If you're changing the files, make sure they keep the same name. Each file is associated with an electrode in the board so that TRACK001.mp3 will play when you touch the electrode 01.
- Connect each alligator wire to the board and plug the speaker as well. Turn the board on and press reset. After the LED light stops blinking touch one of the circles in the map to test it out.


## Tips
- This is a great exercise for kids from 6-10 years. If you're planning to use it with older groups try and update the riddles to give them a bigger challenge üòâ. 
- Have Electric Paint, paint brushes and some blank cards. After the map play, ask each kid to draw whatever they like with it. Then you can connect it to the board - we promise it will make them feel like its magic!
- While they're testing their paintings, its often a good time to explain them what conductive materials are, and why they make Electric Paint work.
- Have fun!
